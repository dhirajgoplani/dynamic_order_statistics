# dynamic_orders_tatistics

Problem Definition: Implement Dynamic Order Statistics using Red Black Tree.
 
We want to support the usual dynamic-set operations from R-B trees, plus:
• OS-SELECT(x, i ): return pointer to node containing the i th smallest key of the
subtree rooted at x.
• OS-RANK(T, x): return the rank of x in the linear order determined by an
inorder walk of T .
